Autotest 4 Delphi README
===

This is a little project for making Continuous Testing possible with Delphi.

In this initial release the code is quite a bit hacked together, 
so the path to the dcc32.exe is currently hardcoded in the source (I know, this is ugly, but it's currently just a 30 min hack)

I apologize for not having done TDD for this project yet ;)
